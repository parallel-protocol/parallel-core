### Foundry

PRIVATE_KEY if it is defined.

```bash
# You don't need to set both of these values, just pick the one that you prefer and set that one
PRIVATE_KEY="PRIVATE KEY"
ALCHEMY_API_KEY="ALCHEMY_API_KEY"
```

### Compile contracts

```bash
bun run compile
```

### Run tests

```bash
bun run test
```

You will find other useful commands in the [package.json](./package.json) file.
